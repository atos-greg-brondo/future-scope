Model Operations, often referred to as "Model Ops," is a crucial aspect of the machine learning and artificial intelligence lifecycle. It involves the deployment, monitoring, and management of machine learning models in production environments. Model Ops ensures that models perform effectively, are regularly updated, and meet business objectives. This includes tasks such as automating model deployment, tracking model performance, handling version control, managing data pipelines, and addressing issues like concept drift or model degradation. In essence, Model Ops bridges the gap between data science and IT operations, ensuring the seamless integration of machine learning models into real-world applications, ultimately maximizing their value and impact.
