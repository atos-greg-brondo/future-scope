AI engineering is a field that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with engineering principles to design, develop, and deploy AI systems. It encompasses the application of algorithms, data science, and machine learning techniques to solve complex problems, automate processes, and create intelligent applications. AI engineers work on various aspects such as data preparation, building scalable AI models, ensuring ethical AI practices, and integrating AI into existing technology infrastructures. The discipline requires a deep understanding of both technical and ethical considerations to build robust, effective, and responsible AI solutions.
