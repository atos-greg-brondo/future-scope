This philosophy recognizes that technology and security measures must be designed with the understanding of human behavior, needs, and rights. It emphasizes the protection of personal data and privacy, ensuring that systems and policies are transparent, accessible, and accountable to users. The goal is to create a secure digital environment that respects user autonomy, promotes trust, and balances security with the fundamental rights to privacy and data protection. This approach is increasingly important in a world where digital technologies are deeply integrated into daily life.</p>
