Data ecosystems refer to the interconnected, dynamic network of data sources, technologies, processes, and stakeholders that collectively facilitate the collection, sharing, analysis, and utilization of data. These ecosystems encompass various data providers, users, and intermediators, enabling the flow of data across different sectors and applications. Within a data ecosystem, the interplay between technological infrastructure, governance models, privacy considerations, and data quality plays a pivotal role in shaping the effectiveness and value generation from data. This concept is crucial in understanding how data-driven insights and innovations are fostered in diverse fields, ranging from business intelligence to public policy.
