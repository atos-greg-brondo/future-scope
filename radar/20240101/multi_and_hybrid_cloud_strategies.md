Multi and Hybrid Cloud Strategies refer to the approaches adopted by organizations to optimize their cloud computing infrastructure. Multi-cloud strategy involves using multiple cloud service providers, such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, simultaneously to meet various business needs. This strategy offers flexibility, redundancy, and the ability to choose the best-fit cloud service for specific workloads. On the other hand, hybrid cloud strategy combines both public and private cloud environments, allowing data and applications to seamlessly move between them. This approach enables organizations to take advantage of the scalability and cost-effectiveness of public clouds while maintaining control and security through private clouds. Overall, these strategies provide businesses with the agility and resource utilization needed to thrive in the digital age.
