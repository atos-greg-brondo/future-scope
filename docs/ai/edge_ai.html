This approach brings AI capabilities directly to the location where data is generated and collected, enabling faster processing and decision-making, as well as reducing latency and bandwidth use. Edge AI is particularly advantageous in scenarios where real-time data processing is critical, such as in autonomous vehicles, smart cameras, and IoT devices. It enhances privacy and security by processing data locally, minimizing the need to send sensitive information to the cloud.</p>
