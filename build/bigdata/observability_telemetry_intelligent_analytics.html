Observability refers to the ability to gain insights into the internal workings of a system, allowing for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting. Telemetry involves the collection and transmission of data from various components within a system, providing valuable information about its performance and behavior. Intelligent analytics, powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), leverages this telemetry data to not only detect issues but also predict and prevent them proactively. It enables businesses to make data-driven decisions, optimize performance, and enhance user experiences by identifying patterns, anomalies, and trends in the data. Together, observability, telemetry, and intelligent analytics form a critical foundation for maintaining the reliability, efficiency, and resilience of complex systems in today's digital landscape.</p>
