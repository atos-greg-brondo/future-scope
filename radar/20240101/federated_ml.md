Federated Machine Learning is a distributed approach to training machine learning models across multiple devices or servers while keeping the data localized. Instead of pooling data into one central server, models are trained on local datasets and only model parameters or updates are shared. This enhances privacy and security, as sensitive data does not leave its original location. It's particularly useful in scenarios where data privacy is crucial, like in healthcare or finance. This method also allows for learning from diverse datasets, potentially improving the robustness and accuracy of models.
