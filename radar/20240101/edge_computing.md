Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the sources of data, like IoT devices, aiming to reduce latency and bandwidth use. In this framework, data is processed by a local computer or server rather than being transmitted to a data center. Internet of Things (IoT), on the other hand, refers to the network of physical objects—"things"—that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet. When combined, Edge computing and IoT can enhance data processing efficiency, making real-time data processing and analysis possible for a wide range of applications, from smart homes to industrial automation.
