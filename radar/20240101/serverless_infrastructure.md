Serverless Infrastructure is a cloud computing model that allows developers to build and deploy applications without the need to manage traditional servers. In this paradigm, the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and scaling of resources, such as compute power and storage, based on the application's needs. Developers focus solely on writing code in the form of functions or microservices, which are executed in response to specific events or triggers. This approach offers benefits such as automatic scalability, reduced operational overhead, and cost optimization, as users only pay for the actual compute resources used during execution, making it an efficient and scalable solution for modern application development.
