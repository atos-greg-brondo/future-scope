These platforms are designed to simplify and speed up the development process, making it accessible even to individuals without extensive programming knowledge. LCAPs often provide drag-and-drop components, model-driven logic, and a range of pre-built templates to facilitate rapid application development. They are particularly useful for businesses looking to develop custom solutions quickly and with limited resources, as they reduce the need for specialized coding skills and shorten development cycles. This democratization of application development empowers more people within an organization to contribute to digital transformation efforts.</p>
