Data Transparency and Sovereignty refers to the principles and practices that govern the openness, accessibility, and control of data within a specific jurisdiction. It emphasizes the importance of making data available in a clear, comprehensible manner, ensuring that individuals and organizations understand how their data is used and managed. Concurrently, it stresses the right of a nation or entity to govern and regulate its own data, maintaining control over its storage, processing, and dissemination. This concept is particularly relevant in the context of global digitalization, where data flows across borders, and involves balancing openness with regulatory control to protect privacy, security, and national interests.
