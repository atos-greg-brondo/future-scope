Vector Databases are a specialized type of database system uniquely tailored to support the demands of generative AI applications. While traditional relational databases primarily deal with structured data, Vector Databases are meticulously crafted to efficiently manage high-dimensional data points, making them indispensable in the realm of generative AI. These databases are specifically designed to handle the intricate vector operations required for tasks like similarity searches, clustering, and vector representation storage, all of which are foundational for powering generative AI models. Whether it's generating creative artworks, natural language text, or recommendations, Vector Databases play a pivotal role in enabling the cutting-edge capabilities of generative AI systems.
