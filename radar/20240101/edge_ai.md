Edge AI refers to the deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms on edge devices, which are hardware located close to the sources of data, such as sensors or local servers, rather than relying solely on cloud computing. This approach brings AI capabilities directly to the location where data is generated and collected, enabling faster processing and decision-making, as well as reducing latency and bandwidth use. Edge AI is particularly advantageous in scenarios where real-time data processing is critical, such as in autonomous vehicles, smart cameras, and IoT devices. It enhances privacy and security by processing data locally, minimizing the need to send sensitive information to the cloud.
