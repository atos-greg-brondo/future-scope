Unlike traditional cloud services that operate from centralized data centers, EPaaS leverages edge computing principles to process data at or near the source, significantly reducing latency and improving performance. This approach is particularly beneficial for applications requiring real-time processing, such as Internet of Things (IoT) deployments, mobile computing, and autonomous systems. EPaaS offers a scalable, flexible infrastructure, enabling businesses to efficiently manage data-heavy applications while optimizing operational efficiency.</p>
