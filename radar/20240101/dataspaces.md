Dataspaces are a concept in data management that provide a flexible approach to data integration. Unlike traditional data integration techniques which require extensive up-front schema design and data cleaning, dataspaces offer a more incremental and user-driven method. They support a wide variety of data models and formats, allowing for the coexistence of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. In dataspaces, all data sources are registered and managed, even if they are not fully integrated. This approach is particularly useful in environments with heterogeneous data sources, facilitating access to and exploration of data without the need for full integration or cleaning in advance.
