Data at the edge refers to the processing and analysis of data at its point of origin or close to where it is generated, rather than in centralized data centers or cloud environments. This approach is commonly used in Internet of Things (IoT) applications, where devices like sensors, smartphones, and machines generate large amounts of data. Processing this data at the edge, near the source, reduces latency, minimizes bandwidth usage, and enhances real-time decision-making. This is particularly important in applications requiring quick responses, like autonomous vehicles or smart city infrastructure. "Data at the edge" enables more efficient and rapid data handling, improving overall system performance and responsiveness.
