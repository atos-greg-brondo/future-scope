A Digital Integration Hub (DIH) is an advanced architectural pattern that centralizes the integration of data from various back-end systems, databases, and external sources. It provides a consolidated, real-time, and efficient data access layer for modern applications and digital services. By leveraging in-memory computing and scalable technologies, DIHs optimize data processing, reduce latency, and improve system performance. This approach supports a range of use cases, including real-time analytics, customer experience enhancement, and digital transformation initiatives. The DIH serves as a bridge, harmonizing data access and integration in complex IT landscapes.
