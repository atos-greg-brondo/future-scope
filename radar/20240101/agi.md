Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to a type of artificial intelligence that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge in a way that is indistinguishable from human intelligence. Unlike narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks, AGI can theoretically perform any intellectual task that a human being can. It involves general cognitive abilities, including reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. The development of AGI is a major goal in the field of AI research, but it remains a largely theoretical and speculative concept, with significant challenges in terms of technology and ethical considerations.
