It serves as a repository where data from various sources is collected, processed, and made available for use in analytics, reporting, and business intelligence tasks. Unlike traditional databases, a data hub is more focused on integration and interaction with different types of data systems, including cloud services and big data systems. It facilitates data sharing and collaboration, ensuring data consistency, accessibility, and security, while supporting data governance practices. Data hubs are pivotal in enabling organizations to leverage their data assets effectively for informed decision-making.</p>
