A vertical landing zone in a cloud hyperscaler refers to a logically isolated area that acts as a landing pad for workloads with specific compliance and security requirements. The landing zone provides governance guardrails through policies, controls, and automation to enforce security, compliance, and consistency for workloads. Some key technical aspects include using separate accounts and virtual networks to isolate the landing zone, restricting access and communication between accounts, configuring central identity and access controls, automating deployment of compliant resources, monitoring configuration drift, and integrating with security services. The goal is to enable consistent, auditable, and secure deployment of regulated workloads at scale across multiple business units in the cloud hyperscaler environment.
