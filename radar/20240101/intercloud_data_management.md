Inter-Cloud Data Management refers to the strategies and technologies used for managing data across multiple cloud computing platforms. This approach is crucial in a multi-cloud environment where data is stored and processed across different cloud services, each with unique characteristics and management requirements. Effective Inter-Cloud Data Management ensures seamless data integration, mobility, and consistency across these platforms. It involves aspects like data synchronization, security, compliance, and access control, addressing challenges in interoperability, data transfer costs, and maintaining data integrity in distributed environments. This concept is vital for organizations leveraging cloud computing for enhanced scalability, flexibility, and efficiency in their data operations.
